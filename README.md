  - when crymson nylium or warped nylium is hoed and can be used as farmland for nether crops.
- Soul Farmland:
  - when soul soil is hoed and lava is its water equivalent can only grow heat based plants.
- Enhanced Farmland:
  - created when a diamond hoe or better is used to till dirt, or on already made farmland (lets water run though it better) and grows crops 2x the speed.
  - gives reason to make better hoes (0_0)

#### Mobs:
- Carbon Mob:
  - Small nether creature that breeds with diamond, drops a block of coal when it is fully grown and killed, but as an adult will drop(lay like a chicken) coal or charcoal periodically, dies instantly in lava or when caught on fire.
#### Features:
- Netherrack Water Absorption:
  - When water is placed in the nether it has a small chance to be absorbed by the netherrack and produce either crymson nylium or warped nylium.
  - The same thing can happen if a mob with moisture(blood) dies but some mobs won't cause it to happen(Enderman, Blaze, Skeleton, Zombie). 
  - Lore: nylium can only grow with moisture or soul energy and blood from dead creatures, that's why it's the only fertile soil in the nether.
