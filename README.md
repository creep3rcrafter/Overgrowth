# Overgrowth
## About:
Overgrowth is a mod that brings more life and diversity to the Overworld, Nether, and End.


### To Do:
#### Items:
- Sulfur cane:
  - it's like sugar cane but can be crafted into sulfur, or (soul paper) can only grow on soul sand next to lava and grows 2x slower than sugar cane.
- Soul paper:
  - can be used for better enchantment books.
- Dark Book:
  - when enchanted it returns better enchants than normal.
-Sulfur:
  - can be used as a fuel and can be used with sugar and charcoal - coal to make gunpowder.
- Nether Carrot:
  - slightly better than an Overworld Carrot, and only grows in Nylium Farmland.
  - Lore: only grows in nylium Farmland because it is the only furtile soil in the nether it has adapted to the low moisture with more roots.
- Nether Beetroot:
  - slightly better than an Overworld Carrot, and only grows in Nylium Farmland.
  - Lore: only grows in nylium Farmland because it is the only furtile soil in the nether it has adapted to the low moisture with more roots.

- End Potato

#### Blocks:
- Nylium farmland:
  - when crymson nylium or warped nylium is hoed and can be used as farmland for nether crops.
- Soul Farmland:
  - when soul soil is hoed and lava is its water equivalent can only grow heat based plants.
- Enhanced Farmland:
  - created when a diamond hoe or better is used to till dirt, or on already made farmland (lets water run though it better) and grows crops 2x the speed.
  - gives reason to make better hoes (0_0)
#### Mobs:
- Carbon Mob:
  - Small nether creature that breeds with diamond, drops a block of coal when it is fully grown and killed, but as an adult will drop(lay like a chicken) coal or charcoal periodically, dies instantly in lava or when caught on fire.
#### Features:
- Netherrack Water Absorption:
  - When water is placed in the nether it has a small chance to be absorbed by the netherrack and produce either crymson nylium or warped nylium.
  - The same thing can happen if a mob with moisture(blood) dies but some mobs won't cause it to happen(Enderman, Blaze, Skeleton, Zombie). 
  - Lore: nylium can only grow with moisture or soul energy and blood from dead creatures, that's why it's the only fertile soil in the nether.
